# docker_fastai

Run a docker container with GPU support on Amazon EC2. Ships with fastai kernel and repository. This repository contains scripts to setup the EC2 instance and to create the docker container. This is not for beginners. Some knowledge of AWS and Docker is required.

## Step 1 Setup your EC2 Instance

### Step 1.1
Launch a p2.xlarge instance with Deep Learning Base AMI (Ubuntu) Version 5.0 (ami-4580a7ae)  
Use the setup.sh bash script to setup Docker and Nvidia-Docker on the EC2 instance.  The bash script is located in the root of this repo. Select "as file" (see screenshots below) 
Make sure to allow SSH and HTTPS traffic in the security group.

### Step 1.2
Connect to your EC2 instance using this [Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html).
Remember to add "ubuntu" as your user. 


## (Optional)

start a TMUX server in your EC2 machine.  `tmux new -s tmuxsession01`
Try to create a couple of panes and sessions. Read some docs on TMUX online. 

## Step 2 Setup the Docker Container

Run the nvidia-docker container:

`nvidia-docker run --name fastai -it -p 8888:8888 rutgerhofste/docker_fastai:ec2v02 bash`

Add `sudo` to this command if your user has insufficient permissions. You can change this [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).


## Step 3 Setup the Jupyter Notebook

### Step 3.1  
Create Credentials to enable HTTPS
`openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout /.keys/mykey.key -out /.keys/mycert.pem`

Fill out the forms. It does not matter how you fill them out since you will likely trust your own certificate, don't you?


### Step 3.2 
Launch the Jupyter Notebook

`jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --certfile=/.keys/mycert.pem --keyfile=/.keys/mykey.key --notebook-dir= /volumes/repos/fastai/ --config=/jupyter_notebook_config.py`

## Step 4  Connect to your notebook

The notebook is now running in a docker container on port 8888. This port is forwarded (-p flag in docker command) to the EC2 host machine. You can connect to the host machine on port 8888 over HTTPS. 

### Step 4.1
Copy the IP of the host machine in the AWS console.

### Step 4.2
Replace the IP with your IP. Make sure to use https.  
https://xx.xx.xxx.xxx:8888 

This has been tested on Firefox and Chrome on Mac and Windows. Note that both browsers force you to explicitly add a security exception to allow the self-signed certificate to be trusted. 


### Step 4.3  
Login. If you did not change the jupyter config file, the standard password is Aqueduct2017!. Consider changing it ASAP.

## Step 5 Happy coding
make sure to use the correct kernel when running fast.ai notebooks. 

Troubleshooting:

1. cannot connect to EC2 machine.
    Make sure the security group allows IP and SSH traffic. See Amazon Tutorials.
